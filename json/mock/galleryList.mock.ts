        "The recent Okta breach, which occurred between September 28, 2023, and October 17, 2023, was initially reported to have affected less than 1% of Okta’s customers. However, subsequent investigations revealed that the breach was more extensive than initially thought, affecting all customers within the compromised system. The breach involved unauthorized access to Okta’s customer support system. The threat actor ran and downloaded a report that contained the names and email addresses of all users in Okta’s customer support system. The majority of the fields in the report were blank, and it did not include user credentials. However, the report did contain session tokens in some HAR files, which could potentially be used by the threat actor. The breach was discovered when a threat actor used stolen login credentials to compromise an Okta support account. The identity of the threat actors behind the breach is not yet known. Okta did not disclose the breach until months after the attack, when a member of Lapsus$ shared screenshots of Okta’s internal systems in a Telegram channel. In response to the breach, Okta has advised all customers to use multi-factor authentication and phishing-resistant methods such as physical security keys. The company has also continued to review its initial analysis and re-examine the actions that the threat actor performed. It’s important to note that Okta’s government customers and its Auth0 support case management system were not impacted by this incident. The only Okta users not impacted by the breach are customers in their FedRAMP and DoD IL4 environments, for whom Okta provides a separate support platform."
